**The Rise of Eco-Friendly Commercial and Residential Projects**

Sustainable real estate is no longer a niche sector in India. Both residential and commercial developments are integrating green technologies to reduce carbon footprints and operational costs. Features such as rainwater harvesting, solar panels, waste management systems, and smart energy solutions are now becoming standard in modern projects.

In cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad, developers are prioritizing sustainability by constructing energy-efficient buildings that comply with global green standards. The shift is largely consumer-driven, as homebuyers and corporate tenants increasingly prefer properties that offer long-term environmental and financial benefits.
